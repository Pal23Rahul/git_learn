Alternative to git pull [Refer : https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21756614/difference-between-git-merge-origin-master-and-git-pull]

1. First update the remote branch using : 
git remote update
    OR
git fetch 
2. Execute git merge origin 


-- To pull changes from an remote branch to an existing local branch 
1. Checkout into that branch -> git checkout <local_branch_name>
2. git pull origin <remote_branch_name>     => Ex - if the remote branch name is git_demo_branch then ==>  git pull origin git_demo_branch 



-- To pull the changes from a remote branch and create a new local branch 
1. git pull origin <remote_branch_name>:<new_local_branch_name>

-- To push changes to an existing remote branch from a local branch 
1. git push origin <local_branch_name>:<remote_branch_name>

-- To push changes from an existing local repo to an unexisting remote branch 
1. git push --set-upstream origin dev_branch

and then further changes can be added by :
1. git push origin

-- To update newly added remote branch in local 
1. git remote update 
OR
1. git fetch
